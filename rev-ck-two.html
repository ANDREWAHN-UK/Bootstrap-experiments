                            <h3>A digression on philosophy, where one wonders what it is all about?</h3>

                            <br>

                            <p>I don't know how the education system works outside of the UK, but here, when you are 16
                                you finish your obligatory schooling. You can choose to go on in the Education system
                                and get your A-Levels, which then open the door to university, or you can enter full
                                time employment, or an apprenticeship (which is we are to believe what is written in
                                Bounce and Talent is Overrated is actually potentially a very useful thing indeed) or
                                some combination therein. </p>


                            <p> You go from studying about 10 subjects, which you then must narrow down to 4 (and then
                                to 3 a year later), which represents quite the shift. In my school, you also got to
                                ditch the uniform. In many ways, it was a rehearsal for university and marked you out as
                                some sort of elite (we were also housed in a separate campus on site) â€“ we were, in
                                short, no longer children, but nearly adults (especially as some people very quickly got
                                cars etc, and also house parties ended up being alcohol fuelled as we all knew someone
                                who was willing and able to buy us booze.) </p>

                            <p> Anyway, before making your choices as to what to study, you got to go to a mini session
                                in your subjects of interest, a sort of try before you buy thing, and I remember going
                                for the English Literature taster. The Teacher in charge was never one of my favourites
                                (too earnest and fanatical for my taste) but I had always liked the subject, and had
                                shown promise in it (which, like many other things, was more than tempered by laziness).
                                In our taster, our Teacher got us to read a poem, then discuss it, but eventually the
                                conversation moved onto Lord of The Rings. He asked us one simple question: </p>

                            <h3>What is it about?</h3>




                            <p> Incredulously (how could he not know what it was about?) I started to outline that it
                                dealt with Frodo Baggins on an impossible quest etc. He stopped me short. "That's the
                                plot" he said, "tell me what the book is about."


                                I was, to put it mildly, discomfited. I, who had read the goddamed thing 8 times (by the
                                way, some context, this was the year when the Fellowship of the Ring was released in
                                cinemas, and boy did I go over that with a fine tooth comb- NO TOM BOMBADIL?!!!) and
                                could recite parts of it etc, I couldn't articulate what it was about. </p>
                            <p> By the end of the class, it seemed the book was about the dichotomy of good and evil
                                (how the Elvish etc rings drew their power from Sauron, and to kill Sauron meant to
                                diminish themselves) and how there are no real happy endings, or clear-cut victories, or
                                how corruptible the heart of man (Isildur) or the influence of progress (the Scouring of
                                the shire) etc. In my defence, there are long, in depth documentaries on the LOTR DVD
                                packs (yes, I bought the Collector's Edition) that still can't quite answer my Teacher's
                                question in a succinct manner, so what hope did I have, in that small and dingy
                                classroom, as a 16 year old stripling? </p>

                            <p> But the central question stayed with me for a long time, and influenced (and continues
                                to do so) how I view things. Whatever a thing is about, it is rarely the narrative of
                                the thing that provides the answer. That narrative can be seen as scaffolding, or scene
                                setting, but it is never what it is about. </p>


                            <p> That question surfaced recently when I was reading this series on <a
                                    href=https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/tag/game-of-checkers > PC Gamer </a> (a magazine
                                that got me hooked into pc
                                games some 16 years ago...) and also thinking about Game of Thrones. That's another
                                literary series that I'm proud to say I was all geeked up on before it became popular.
                                Now every man and his dog (except me, btw, I refuse to do so) has watched the series,
                                and even my brother, who as a dyslexic has probably never finished a book in his life,
                                is reading the series, and enjoying it. If I were to ask the man on the street (or
                                woman, seeing as we live in such gender sensitive times...) that taut, tight, condensed
                                question, what is it about, I wonder what they would say? </p>
                            <img class="rev-image" src="https://i.imgur.com/Gxsqbce.jpg" alt="image from Game of Thrones">


                            <h3> What would you say? </h3>


                            <h3> Would you give me a narrative? </h3>

                            <h3> Would you talk about the Borgias? </h3>

                            <h3> Would you mention the Dothraki? </h3>

                            <h3> Or would you just talk about the nudity and violence? </h3>






                            <p> </p> Reading that article made me think that Crusader Kings 2 consistently throws up
                            these amazing stories. I had dabbled a bit in this Paradox title, but it had never drawn me
                            in. A good gamer friend of mine plays Europa Universalis a great deal, and seems to love it.
                            Living in a Golden Age of gaming means there are more games than ever before, and the bar is
                            getting set higher. Had World of Magic released 10 years ago it would, I imagine, have been
                            very well received, but it came out facing the competition in the forms of Age of Wonders 3
                            and Endless Legend. I talk elsewhere about what I think of those 2 games. Basically, I
                            decided that dropping Â£30+ on EU4 wasn't a realistic proposition (actually, the truth is I'm
                            feeding a growing <a href=tabletop.html>Board games addiction,</a> and those things are
                            not cheap...) and reading the RPS article gave me the shove I needed to reinstall and try
                            out CK2 again. I mean, this thing has sold very well indeed, and it's not like me to be so
                            far behind the zeitgeist on something.


                            <p> <em> NB: what follows isn't a review as such, as my policy is to play 50 hrs+ of a game
                                    before writing a review, and for reasons outlined below, that is going to
                                    be...challenging.</em> </p>
                            <p> I recently realised, as I detail when talking about it, that Endless Legends and AoW3
                                are very different games, and trying to play them like each other is the root cause of
                                why some don't like the other. It made me think that as a player, you should really know
                                what is a game about? With that question burning at the forefront of my mind, I
                                fearfully dipped a toe in Crusader Kings 2. </p>


                            <p> I booted it up, remembering that the last time I did so I didn't survive the
                                tutorial because it was possibly the <em>worst </em> tutorial I have ever come
                                across. When I say I didn't survive, what happened was that I was given an
                                instruction to carry out and no way to do so, so it got uninstalled. Fundamentally,
                                I play games for fun, more on this later... </p>

                            <p> </p> So, installed and patched, I notice there is a new tutorial, casting me as the
                            King of Leon. My interest piqued (+ 1 to Paradox). I know the places on this map. I have
                            been to Salamanca, visited the university there, and gotten gloriously drunk on its
                            cobbled streets. I've been to Valladolid (which claims the purest Spanish of all). I
                            spent a week in Galicia, enjoying some delectable seafood and learning that Celtic
                            culture (to a degree) is alive and well there (surprising, given that for most people
                            Spain is this very Romanesque Latin culture bastion, hell the language itself is very
                            close to Latin, more so than French for sure) â€“ they even have bagpipes!



                            <p> </p> I have even run with the bulls in Pamplona (lots of fun, not nearly as
                            dangerous as people would have you believe â€“ I got kicked in the head, and I'm still
                            sane, right? RIGHT?!)



                            <p> </p> And so, I started. The tutorial wasn't useful. I was told to set an ambition to
                            get married, and then via my leader portrait told to select a wife from the list. The
                            thing is, it made much more sense to select the regions I was most interested in
                            (Castille, Navarra, Galicia if you must know) and find an eligible lady there and talk
                            to her directly. Still cumbersome, with many clicks involved, but I got myself married,
                            and easier than going through a list (minor fail). Then it told me to invade the Canary
                            Islands. I spend some time every year in Gran Canaria so I had no problems doing this.
                            Anyway, this incident was intended to show me how to fabricate a claim, which as a
                            mechanic is really a very good idea (epic plus). I raised my vassals as instructed, and
                            raised my ships as instructed, which were too few, so I hired some mercenaries, as
                            instructed. I sent all the ships to port, as instructed, and my armies to that port, as
                            instructed. Then I sent my soldiers onto the ships, as instructed.




                            <p> </p> No dice. Nada. Nothing. Did not work. I reread the instructions, nothing was
                            working. I tried splitting my armies, nothing helped. In vexation I went to the Steam
                            forums to ask for help, and was told to make sure my ships were in harbour. So, back to
                            the game, visually checking the screen â€“ they looked like they were in the harbour, but
                            there was nothing to tell me, via a tooltip, that they were there.




                            <p> First <em>Epic Fail </em>(please keep count as I continue to rant), and not on me
                                either. Game design, more accurately User Interface, at fault. </p>



                            <p> I figured it out eventually. Yes, they were in harbour, but the ships, all 44 of
                                them by this point, were not combined as a navy, even though they were occupying
                                exactly the same space. I had to select the disparate fleets and combine them as a
                                Navy, but the game never once thought to tell me this. This is a remarkably simple
                                thing to do (providing instruction, and yes, also combining them in game is simple).
                                In AoW3, if your 3 ships occupy the same hex as 2 other friendly ships, they become
                                a single fleet of 5 ships. It's intuitive, it makes sense, it's an obvious thing (If
                                the space is occupied by unfriendly ships, you start a fight). </p>



                            <h3> Epic Fail. </h3>



                            <p> In disgust, I stopped the tutorial, and figured that Paradox were clearly
                                incompetent at making tutorials that made sense and actually helped the player.
                                Steam seemed to agree with me as well, for what that's worth. I decided that
                                ultimately, as I know enough (from reading other peoples' stories incidentally)
                                about the game mechanics (here I refer to things like intrigue, plots, fabricating
                                claims) to start my own game. </p>



                            <p> I decide to start as the King of Leon again. My Uncle is causing me trouble, and I
                                am very intrigued. My brothers are the Rulers of Galicia and Castille, so I am
                                wondering why Uncle Pedro was passed over. Was he related to my Father? Was my
                                Father King of all 3 Kingdoms (doubtful, as I imagine he would have kept them
                                together)? How did we get to this situation? Uncle Pedro kept hassling me for his
                                own Realm, but he hates me so much that I knew that was a dicey proposition. I got
                                rid of him a.s.a.p. So, game has my interest, <em> epic plus. </em> I realise I can
                                get these answers online, but put it this way â€“ a game, a largely passive source of
                                entertainment, especially this one, has got me asking questions and wanting to know
                                more. </p>




                            <h3>That is amazing. </h3>




                            <p> I set myself the goal of uniting these 3 Kingdoms, facing down the Moors and uniting
                                the Peninsula. In reality, from the start date given of 1066, it took until 1492 for
                                the Spaniards to do this, and they couldn't get Portugal either. At that point,
                                having taken back the Alhambra they then decided upon adventures in America, then
                                went on to dominate Europe and the world before the English descended upon them like
                                vampiric Pirates eventually destroying the Grand Armada . These times are well
                                remembered in La CoruÃ±a by the way, as they commemorate facing down and defeating
                                Francis Drake. In a similar way, we British remember specific things like the events
                                of a Bridge Too Far which for the Germans is probably of more academic interest
                                (they're more likely to remember Dresden or Stalingrad than Arnhem). </p>




                            <p> So, in this game, I decided to press my legitimate claim to the Throne of Galicia. I
                                know it's legitimate, even if a weak, claim because the game tells me so with
                                notifications at the top of the screen <em>minor </em>plus) so I start the war. </p>



                            <p> The war seems to go okay, I mean I win the first few fights, but I don't really know
                                how or why I am, other than having more troops. I also then get sucked into long
                                sieges that take seemingly forever. At this point I'm thinking this is realistic,
                                but really a bit boring. A graphical makeover could be done here, surely? I'm going
                                to say minor plus here. </p>

                            <p> And then my levies start getting fractious, as they've been away from their farms
                                too long. This is incredible, in the sense of straining credulity, not in the sense
                                of something good. They have successfully captured 3 enemy towns, looted them and
                                are presumably full of someone else's grain, yet they want to go back to their
                                farms? This is a war that is going well ... </p>


                            <h3>minor fail.</h3>


                            <p> And then the King of Castille decides to join the party, and promptly marches past
                                all my cities to attack me while I am in Galicia. I lose, and badly, and then I
                                realise one thing about this game: </p>


                            <p> The combat is atrocious. The abstraction of warfare is ridiculous, really
                                unrealistic (in a game that prides itself on historical accuracy) and really no fun at
                                all. It's not an exaggeration to say I have finally found a combat system I detest more
                                than that of Endless Legend. </p>


                            <p> It's that bad, and the thing is, looking at this as a consumer, there is absolutely
                                no need for it to be so bad. I'm not asking for total tactical control, and oddly
                                enough, in this setting, I could see the Endless Legend system actually working
                                extremely well. </p>




                            <h3>Sad to say, EPIC fail.</h3>




                            <p>And then it hit me, what this game is about. You may already have reached the same
                                conclusions as I, but here it is: </p>




                            <h3><em>It's about people (and as an extension, their dynasty and kingdom), their
                                    relations and ambitions. It's a story generator. </em></h3>



                            <p> It most emphatically is not about medieval warfare (by the way, is there a game that
                                is about this? I know Pike and Shot is late medieval/renaissance warfare, and is
                                apparently very good, and is, paradoxically, a Paradox title as well. I mean,
                                Medieval Total War 1 and 2 are all about battles, but I'd hardly call them medieval
                                simulators), medieval life (other than nearly every rpg being vaguely set in
                                medieval times). It's not a grand strategy game either, and it's not an Empire
                                Builder game (which is a more accurate term for what people refer to as 4x games).
                            </p>


                            <p> Crusader Kings, when you boil it down, is basically the Sims, with Medieval trapping
                                and none of the busy work of bathing your people.

                                It's also why it fits so incredibly well with Game of Thrones (that's about people
                                and ambition too by the way).
                            </p>
                            <p> Simply put, this is a game about managing your dynasty and your bloodline, and
                                everything else around it is there to facilitate this. Now, it helps that the game does
                                that very well (it also helps that it features a time period that it's target audience
                                both know and enjoy very much). Your mileage may vary considerably with this game, but
                                the essential draw is a timeless one â€“ people like and dislike people, and playing this
                                game you can create stories. Stories, especially one where you can get the player
                                involved, are always timeless. </p>



                            <p> Just don't come in here expecting to reprise your Total war role as the King of
                                England who outclassed all on the battlefield. I don't think it is even possible to
                                emulate the Battle of Agincourt, but it may be possible to recreate the Hundred
                                Years war. (which is precisely the inverse of Total War!)
                            </p>
                            <p> As a bloodline/dynasty management game, it excels, but as a strategy, or wargame, it
                                is terrible.

                                Anyway, last thought on Crusader Kings, a game I will continue to play and one that
                                will continue to vex me:

                                "A game is a way to play by a set of rules. Good rules help you find the fun, bad
                                rules obscure it. But the rules are not, themselves, the fun."

                            <p>Substitute 'rules' for 'game mechanics' (which is more relevant a term for computer
                                games) and this encapsulates my thoughts on Crusader Kings 2: there's a great game
                                to be had there, hiding under some bizarre UI stuff and atrocious combat rules.</p>



                            <p> Now imagine if somehow, satisfying (a nebulous term, as there are many different
                                representations of battle) battles were brought into this format?</p>


                            <h3> Wouldn't that be a grand game?</h3>



                            <p> Something that brought the satisfaction of a Total War battle, wrapped it up in the
                                dynasty management, politics and relationship simulator of Crusader Kings 2, but
                                without the tedium of Total War (oh yay, another battle, and no way to end a war) or
                                the opaque interface/mechanic interplay of Crusader Kings?

                                Well, it turns out someone has that same idea. Actually, I imagine that if I've had
                                this idea, then countless others have, but in this case, someone has tried to
                                implement said idea...

                                Enter Massive Chalice, stage left, which will be the subject of my next article.

                                Enter Sovereignty, stage right, which I shall write about soon. </p>
