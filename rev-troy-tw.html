                            <h2> The Iliad, passed through a popcorn movie and then rendered in a Total War “saga.”
                                With the intriguing premise that maybe there was some kernel of truth to all the legends
                                But
                                is this game θρίαμβος (triumph) or τραγωδία (tragedy?)</h2>


                            <p> A “saga” is basically a story, such as that of Beowulf, but in this context, it
                                refers to a bite-sized, condensed, focussed form of a Total war game:</p>

                            <blockquote> “Total War Saga games will be standalone spin-off titles focusing
                                on exciting pivotal moments in history rather than whole historical eras.”</blockquote>

                            <blockquote> “key, pivotal points in history which don’t necessarily revolve
                                around a single character, and only lasted a few months or few decades at most. Such
                                moments
                                also tend to be constrained to a tight geographic area as well.”</blockquote>

                            <p> In the Iliad the wronged Greeks wage war on the Trojans, eventually succeeding
                                through the ruse of the Trojan Horse.</p>
                            <p> In the movie, the same basic story unfolds, <a
                                    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agamemnon#Return_to_Greece>skipping some bits</a>
                                and <a href=https://youtu.be/j2zxmXXTtDE>adding some stuff</a> because, well, Hollywood.

                            =================##=================<br>
                            <p> In Troy Total War, however, despite some generous, ahem, borrowing of the imagery
                                from the film:</p>

                            <img src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3b/66/22/3b6622e9385ffe46a8b332108a69dae1.jpg>

                            This is Agamemnon
                            <img src=https://i.imgur.com/rCJmADI.png>




                            <p> Hector goes entirely off-script, and invades from half the map away, with suspicious
                                accuracy and timing. </p>

                            <h3> And thus ends my first playthrough.</h3>
                            <p> Thankfully, I’ve been keeping up on my <a
                                    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soteria_(mythology)>sacrifices to Soteria,</a>
                                and so I escape
                                miraculously unharmed, and Zeus intervenes to let me have another go (The new game
                                button is
                                godly!)</p>


                            <p> This time, Hector stays very far away, and armed with considerably more wisdom, I
                                pay more attention to what my agents do, specifically my Envoys, who reduce the upkeep
                                of my
                                armies, which is an incredibly powerful ability that the game “help” never explains,
                                despite
                                its tedious loquacity (I had to turn all help messages off because I was getting swamped
                                with useless messages.)</p>
                            <p> I get my resource engine going and start to have fun, and then notice that Hector
                                must have been training everyone else, because I then get enemy armies marching past 3
                                or 4
                                other cities, belonging to people they are at war with, and homing in on an undefended
                                settlement, and then I notice this happens as soon as I move my main stack out of my
                                homeland.</p>

                            <h3> And so ends my second playthrough</h3>

                            <h3> And my third…</h3>

                            <h4> And so, we come to the first Achilles Heel, or ἁμαρτία (hamartia, meaning
                                weakness, flaw) if you will.</h4> <br>

                            <h1> Weaknesses</h1>


                            <h2>ἁμαρτία number 1: Cheating AI</h2>
                            <p>I’m starting with this, because it is in my opinion the single worst thing about the
                                game.
                                In my first 3 playthroughs, I was Agamemnon. Why him? Well, the game says this is the
                                “easy”
                                start, so it made sense to start with him. However, I am not convinced this evaluation
                                is
                                correct. You start in a fairly precarious position, and the game help is not helpful
                                (I’ll
                                discuss that a bit more later.) I say precarious, although “confusing” also applies. You
                                are
                                the purple. Red is your enemy., Green are your friends. And directly north you have
                                neutrals. )</p>

                            <p>You are surrounded by nominal allies and neutrals, and only one clear enemy, directly to
                                the
                                south. You also have just 2 settlements, and no complete provinces (some High King….)
                                and,
                                if you take out the Corinthians and the Tiryians then you have 2 provinces, but are then
                                almost completely hemmed in. There really isn’t anywhere convenient to go, because the 2
                                people nearest to you are Diomedes (stronger) and Ajax (equal) who are your allies.
                                Further
                                afield, you have the other Greek states, but, unlike for example pretty much all the
                                factions in Total Warhammer, there isn’t a clear path for you to go and get established
                                and
                                seeing as this is a turn-based game, the longer this goes on the more you find yourself
                                spinning your wheels, unable to expand and condemned to defence, forever.</p>

                            <img src=https://i.imgur.com/PvqjSGG.png?1>

                            <p> Here your position is purple. You are hemmed in by friends east and west (in green) and
                                start at war with the reds to the south. To the north, all neutrals</p>
                            <p>Now, difficult expansion in and of itself is not a problem, however…</p>
                            <h4>Game 1:</h4>
                            <p>Consolidate start position, crack some skulls in the west, take some cities, get attacked
                                by
                                Hector, who somehow lands just as my armies are in the west, and who conveniently
                                bypasses
                                many other possible targets.</p>

                            <h4>Game 2:</h4>
                            consolidate again, expand west, keep an eye out for the Trojans, get surprised by
                            the northern Greeks, who again decide to invade conveniently just as there is little
                            defence, and also, again suspiciously conveniently, decide to ignore several enemy cities
                            (as in my allies, their enemies) and come straight for me.

                            <h4>Game 3:</h4>
                            <p>consolidate area, decide to focus on the northern Greeks, because it looked like my
                                ally Diomedes has the western Greeks nicely sewn up. Then see said western Greeks, down
                                to
                                one single city, magically spawn an entire army of troops more advanced than anything I
                                have
                                (with about 7 cities by this point) and then march past 4 of Diomedes’ cities, which
                                were
                                all undefended, get to my cities, sack one, and then run away just as my main stack
                                arrives.</p>

                            <p>And this just repeats itself.</p>

                            <p>It gets almost farcical when you realise that you can force the Ai into a weird dance by
                                shuffling just enough of an army (i.e., your B-team) around your hometown, e.g., move
                                out of
                                homeland, let Ai approach, shuffle back, AI gets cold feet, and in the meantime your
                                main
                                army (your A-team) pops up behind them.</p>

                            <p>But this is only possible if you are willing to engage in the diplomacy system, in order
                                to
                                afford the rather high upkeep of having all these soldiers. Evidently, this resource
                                constriction (which I would otherwise applaud) magically doesn’t apply to the AI, who
                                can
                                have huge amounts of food generated from almost no territory </p>

                            

                            <h2>ἁμαρτία number 2: Confusing and sometimes annoying diplomacy system.</h2>

                            And speaking of resources, now is a good time to bring up another weakness, namely,
                            <img src= https://i.imgur.com/1bhr2t6.png> 
                            <img src= https://i.imgur.com/ayTb83R.png>
                            
                            <h3>Greedy AI</h3>
                            <p> No, I don’t want to trade 5000 of my food, which I am spending more than I earn due
                            to needing a second army, in return for 500 wood, of which I am producing a surplus,
                            thankyou very much.</p> 

                            <p>And no I don’t want to trade my hard earned, scarce gold for yet more wood, or
                            stone. </p> 

                            <p> And no I don’t want to do this 3 or 4 times every turn.</p> 
                            <p> And no you can’t have my bronze.</p> 
                            <p> Whilst on the topic of diplomacy, the system is more sophisticated than in Total
                            Warhammer, not least because you have various resources (more on this later) but also
                            because you can set up trade agreements for a limited amount of time, set up one-time
                            exchanges and also <em> trade regions. </em> That last is extremely useful and something
                            that should go forward into every single Total war game in the future.</p> 
                            <p> However, all of this means there are, imho, simply too many buttons in the menu
                            (screenshot), likely to induce either analysis paralysis or a simple φύγε! reaction in the
                            player, at least the first few times you see it.</p> 

                            <p> One last note about the diplomacy, touched upon when mentioning the start position,
                            is that the game begins with various alliances set up, a quite complicated web of agreements
                            and non-aggression pacts etc, and it is quite the cognitive overload to keep track of who is
                            allied to who, and who isn’t (and therefore fair game for my warring)</p> 

                            <p>  The map:
                            
                            <img src=https://i.imgur.com/dszG8q3h.png> <br>often looks more like a soup of icons than a map. Your
                            mileage may vary, obviously, and to be fair, eventually you learn to just flat out ignore a
                            lot of it.</p>

                            <p> There is an upside to this though, namely, it is much harder to game the AI into
                            unfavourable diplomacy.</p>

                            <p> It wasn‘t fun the first time, and definitely not the 15th time…To be fair, this is
                            fairly minor. However, unlike my other minor annoyances, such as ridiculous projectiles
                            trails or very unhelpful “help” messages, these cannot be skipped.</p> 



                            <h1> You’ll be happy to know that there are notably more strengths, or ρώμη (strength,
                            vigour, sturdiness) than there are weaknesses</h1> <h3>
                                First, let’s talk about the graphics.</h3>

                                <p> ρώμη In my opinion, they really nailed the theme. From the moment you boot the
                                game, you know what time period, and what mythos, you are dealing with.</p> 
                                ( )

                                For example, look at this:
                                ( The sky box, with the lion just chilling…that’s a really cool thing to do.

                                <p> </p> ρώμη And it’s not just visual either. They use quotes to emphasise what is
                                going on, and tie things together.


                                Screenshot of Patroclus quote.
                                I especially like that they don’t try to sanitise the quotes too much, because I was a
                                bit worried they would gloss over certain things, like homosexual attitudes of the 
                                the time. (link to Wikipedia article)
                                Moving away from the theme,
                                <p> </p> ρώμη Different resources, forcing scarcity at least in early game (i.e. food,
                                bronze etc)
                                Some people would say this over complicates things, but in my view, it is a delicious
                                wrinkle in the decision making. It feels a bit retrograde to return to Total Warhammer 2
                                after this, with just one resource, i.e. gold (and yes I am aware that there are
                                “strategic resources” in that game, such as dyes or furs, that unlock things, but that’s
                                not quite the same thing.)
                                Having some units require bronze to recruit, and sometimes as upkeep (and bear in mind,
                                in all my games bronze was hardly plentiful) acts as a highly effective, and imho
                                thematic, limiter on accessing higher level troops. Your mileage may vary here, because
                                it is much harder to assemble something approaching a stack of doom. The resource
                                bottleneck requires you think about how many shielded spearmen (for example ) you want,
                                and how to use them. Scarcity breeds creativity, a fact sometimes lost among those who
                                always want more MORE!
                                <p> </p> ρώμηI think many people will actually just gloss over this, but I think it is
                                one of the cleverer things in the game, namely the interesting take on mythology e.g.
                                the “Cyclops” or “sirens” (Humans obviously) as your agents or units ( )

                                <p> </p> Ρώμη Linked to this is the implementation of religion (ss of the gods panel )
                                where you can sacrifice resources to gain benefits. I do imagine however, that over a
                                very long campaign, keeping the gods happy would become either necessary busywork, or
                                largely irrelevant. In my games however, the extra growth afforded by keeping Aphrodite
                                happy was particularly useful.
                                <p> </p> Even if not particularly realistic, or accurate, both systems fit in the game
                                quite nicely, and make sense, within the game context.

                                <p> </p> On a more technical note, Ρώμη In game encyclopaedia (screenshot ) works far
                                better than in TW Warhammer (screenshot of it not working ). In fact, this may be the
                                single best in game encyclopaedia CA has put out. Again, this is something where YMMV
                                quite widely. I personally really appreciate having rules and explanations accessible
                                and consistent, which is no doubt because I play so many board games.
                                <p> </p> Ρώμη Loading times are considerably faster than in Warhammer. I am on a mid
                                range computer, so this makes a huge difference to me.


                                <h2></h2> Now, let’s talk about things that are, in my opinion, a bit more ακαθάριστος,
                                or neutral.

                                <h3> </h3> First of all, the battles.
                                <p> </p> Now, considering that the battles are the centrepiece of a Total war game, it
                                is perhaps a bit sad that I consider them, in this iteration, merely serviceable. There
                                aren’t many horrendous things happening. The worst part about the battles is CA still
                                insists on named characters being superheroes, which is also reflected in the strategic
                                map where it seems none of your heroes actually dies but is merely incapacitated for a
                                few turns. It makes a certain kind of sense, considering this is supposed to be a myth
                                in game form, but it does detract from everything for me. At least it is not as bad as
                                in Total War: Three Kingdoms. In battles themselves, the lower-level units that you are
                                going to use for a long time tend to break a bit too quickly. The idea is that it
                                reflects how unit cohesion was (and still is by the way) especially important, and how
                                in ancient battles, the actual casualty rate in any one battle was quite low in absolute
                                numbers (but high relative to the population,) and how most of the casualties came when
                                people started to run away. (link to ACOUP)

                                <p> </p> In that sense, it is more realistic, but coming to this from other Total War
                                games is a bit jarring, because here you have to be actively prepared for your units to
                                rout, then reform later, so you need to plan your battlefield formations accordingly.
                                <p> </p> It leads to a weird sense of messy, scrappy battles, which, again, may or may
                                not be realistic, but certainly takes some getting used to.
                                <p> </p> At first, I did not like it, but the system slowly grew on me, and it makes
                                those higher morale unts worth their weight in…err…bronze?
                                <p> </p> The system can be gamed somewhat because morale losses trigger on being flanked
                                or attacked to the rear, even if the flanking unit is, realistically, not a threat. You
                                can do it with your superhero for example.
                                <p> </p> Also, as is now standard in TW games, your units seemingly cannot push other
                                units away, which is something that was in Rome: Total War, and which was awesome (a
                                phalanx could be used to dislodge an enemy unit.)


                                <h3> </h3> Secondly, the UI.

                                <p> </p> It could be that I am just used to how things work in Total War games, but I
                                found the UI here largely quite good, certainly fit for purpose, and the things I didn’t
                                like about it are really design choices, not faults as such. For example, the upgrade
                                paths for your agents and characters consists of a ladder of binary choices, and I much
                                preferred the Total Warhammer implementation, where you had 3 or 4 distinct upgrade
                                paths, and you just followed them. (screenshot of TW Warhammer 2 hero upgrades )
                                (screenshot of Troy hero upgrades )
                                <p> </p> There is one more thing worth mentioning, which is an irritation in every
                                single TW game, and in some others besides. When my turn starts, I am deluged by a bunch
                                of messages which have to be clicked away in order for me to get to the thing I actually
                                want to do. And most of those messages aren’t useful.

                                Click! Click! Click! Click! OK now you can play.

                                <h2></h2> Conclusion:
                                <p> </p> As we approach our έξοδος (exodus,) my final thoughts:
                                <p> </p> Compared to the bombastic madness of Total Warhammer, or the massive scale of
                                Rome etc, or the sheer density of Three Kingdoms,

                                <h3> </h3> Troy is:
                                <p> </p> Succinct, condensed, refined, distilled, inventive, pithy, occasionally divine,
                                and, appropriate to the subject matter, laconic.
                                (caption: at this point, I absolutely MUST emphasise that the Spartans were pretty
                                rubbish in reality. Read more here.)

                                <h3> </h3> And yet, also
                                <p> </p> Scattered, unfocussed, cheating, borked, and, also appropriate to the subject
                                matter, sisyphean.

                                (picture of Sisyphus!)
                                These are all adjectives that come close to describing the essence of Troy Total War.

                                <p> </p> But the real question is, will I be playing this again? And the answer is yes,
                                but first, I have a Book of Grudges to attend to (link to page about Dwarves in TW:
                                Warhammer 2.)

                                <h2></h2> TLDR:
                                <h3> </h3> You might like this game if…

                                <p> </p> You want a Total war game with a distinct sense of style.
                                <p> </p> Carefully thinking about your unit composition and resources appeals to you.
                                <p> </p> You are tired of fireballs.


                                <h3> </h3> You might not like this game if…

                                <p> </p> You want to get to the action.
                                <p> </p> cheating AI is your nemesis (sorry I had to get that word in here somehow!)
                                <p> </p> You really like fireballs.
                                <p> </p> super powered named characters break your immersion.
